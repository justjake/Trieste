# Trieste

Work in progress diving app for Apple Watch Ultra.

## What's the name about?

The app is named after the bathyscaphe Trieste, the first vessel to dive to the lowest place on Earth, the Mariana Trench.

## Roadmap

1. Clone Apple's Depth app, but with worse design.
2. Store dive history, allow viewing any dive in the list.
3. Compute Buhlmann decompression model (starting point: https://github.com/markdgray/openhaldane/blob/master/software/model.py).
4. Write dive history to Notion.
5. Record GPS position for beginning and end of the dive.
6. Design.
